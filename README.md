# Instant_Snap

Don't miss a moment. Instantly snap a pic from anywhere on your phone.
Let's say you see a Lamborghini speed past you on the road or maybe you see an animal with a silly expression on it's face or you saw some incriminating evidence that needs be to recorded before its take away. Usually you would need to do 4 things. Go to the Home Screen. Find your camera app. Wait for the camera to load. Tap the shutter button.
With Instant Snap, that is no longer the case. Activating Instant Snap turns on an always on top overlay shutter button similar to Facebook Messenger's overlay button. Pressing the button will make your phone take a picture then and there. This button will appear on top of any application you are using and can be dragged and moved to different locations to keep from being an inconvenience. 

Temporarily from the market due to incompatability with Samsung devices.
